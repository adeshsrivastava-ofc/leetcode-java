# 🚀 LeetCode Java

Daily LeetCode problem solving using **Java 21**, structured for long-term consistency, interview preparation, and clean engineering practices.

---

## 🧠 Goals
- Solve LeetCode problems daily
- Write clean, readable, and efficient Java code
- Organize solutions by problem category (arrays, DP, trees, etc.)
- Maintain discipline with tests, commits, and CI

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java 21 (OpenJDK via Homebrew)
- **Build Tool:** Maven
- **Testing:** JUnit 5
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA
- **CI:** GitHub Actions (planned)
